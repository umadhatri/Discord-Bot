# Discord-Bot
This is a repo to share the basic code to create a bot that dishes out inspirational/deep quotes whenever someone prompts the bot.

# Discord
Discord is a real-time chat service where users can create their own 'servers' that host various chat rooms where users can chat with friends as well as bots

# Why an inspirational bot?
I found that an inspirational bot was probably the easiest one for me to code, so i did that 

# About the code
I used Python to make this bot. You can also use JavaScript to do that. Do make sure you have a discord developer account and that you generate your own API Keys to run your bot. They are called Keys for a reason. Do make sure you have your key stored somewhere safe and that you don't give it away because that can wreak havoc in your server

# What do I intend to do with it?
I do intend to keep the server running and if anyone wants to join, I'll provide a link to join my Robot Family Server. Just type in $inspire in the chat to generate a random inspirational quote from the bot. Oh and also, if anyone's asking, I used the zenquotes.io api in my code!
